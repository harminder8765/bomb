		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Richmond Station is a neighbourhood restaurant. We grew up
		   with a passion for those romantic neighbourhood spots where
		   you could reliably grab a bite to eat once a month, two nights
		   in a row or whenever the fridge was bare. A neighbourhood spot 
		   means the owners are around most days, the staff maintain their
		   position for years and there’s too many familiar faces to really 
		   just “be in and out”. Your favourite items never leave the menu
		   and if they do, the chef wants to make it for you all the same.
		</p></div>

		 <h2>WHERE IT ALL STARTED</h2>
		 <hr>
		 <p>
	
		 We’re located on Richmond St, just a few doors west from the
		   intersection at Yonge St. This is one of the busiest places in 
		   the city and the downtown core always seems to be developing more
		   and more energy. In the early 1980’s, downtown Toronto was not
		   really a hub for great restaurants. To eat well you either needed 
		   to sit down for a nice meal in one of the hotels, like The Sutton
		   Place or The King Edward; unless of course you wanted to venture 
		   up to Scaramouche or Fenton’s. For decades, Canoe has been the 
		   beacon of eating out downtown, and so it remains. Richmond Station is
		   blessed to be in the middle of a vibrant community of great independent
		   restaurants like La Betolla di Terroni, Drake 150, and Lena.

		<h2>THE NEW DOWNTOWN</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>What’s changed more than the restaurant options downtown is the amount
		   of  who live now downtown. In the 80’s and even 90’s, you could roll
		   a bowling ball down Bay St during the weekend. Now the core is bustling
		   with peopleshopping dining, watching live sports and touring the 
		   architecture. There are evenmore great hotels with the Shangri La 
		   and The St. Regis Hotel opening within the same year as Richmond
		   Station. We really feel like our restaurant is in the heart  of
		   a vibrant city that seemingly continues to grow and thrive. 
		   welcome everyone and anyone that happens to be travelling through:
		   having a business meeting, snacking before the Jays game, just back 
		   from a matinee at the opera, shopping at The Eaton Centre. Or maybe 
		   you just live around here.</p>
		   <p>Richmond Station opened in October 2012. The first meal we ate 
			  here was a Thanksgiving dinner, together as a staff. Our moms
			  and dads were milling about helping to clean, paint and be enthusiastic.
			  We cleared away enough construction site to push a dozen tables together 
			 and even today we can’t remember what we ate. The food was important, but
			 getting to know each other seemed a higher priority. That first meal will 
			 forever be among our most favourite.</p>
